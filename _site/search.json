In particular, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is useful for ‘clustering’ text into groups of similar meanings. Similar to k-means Clustering algorithms, the number of topics (or ‘clusters’) k is the most important parameter to define. In the event that k is too small, the topics may be over-generalised; if k is too large, however, topics may be overlapping or not useful for interpretation. To determine the optimal number of topics k, the FindTopicsNumber plot is used to compare models for different values of k.\n\nI: Create DTM from text dataframeII: Create models with different k valuesIII: Plot Results to Find Optimum kIV: Compute the LDA Model\n\n\n\nnodes_unnest_filtered <- nodes_unnest %>%\n  filter(!word %in% c(\"products\", \"including\", \"well\", \"related\", \"services\", \"source\", \"materials\", \"goods\", \"offers\", \"range\", \"unknown\", \"freelance\")) %>% \n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n\ndtm2 <- nodes_unnest_filtered %>%\n  count(id, word) %>% \n  cast_dtm(id, word, n) %>%  \n  as.matrix()\n\n\n\n\nresult <- ldatuning::FindTopicsNumber(\n  dtm2,\n  topics = seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 1),\n  metrics = c(\"Griffiths2004\", \"CaoJuan2009\", \"Arun2010\", \"Deveaud2014\"),\n  method = \"Gibbs\",\n  control = list(seed = 123),\n  verbose = TRUE\n)\n\nfit models... done.\ncalculate metrics:\n  Griffiths2004... done.\n  CaoJuan2009... done.\n  Arun2010... done.\n  Deveaud2014... done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nFindTopicsNumber_plot(result)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, Maximising Griffiths2004 and Deveaud2014 and Minimizing CaoJuan2009 and Arun2010 scores show that k = 6 topics seems to be optimal.\n\n\n\n# set random number generator seed\nset.seed(1234)\n\n# compute the LDA model\nlda_topics <- LDA(dtm2, 6, \n                  method=\"Gibbs\", \n                  control=list(iter = 500, verbose = 25)) %>% \n  # Extract estimated topic-term probabilities (beta) matrix from LDA results\n  tidy(matrix = \"beta\")\n\nK = 6; V = 7719; M = 3870\nSampling 500 iterations!\nIteration 25 ...\nIteration 50 ...\nIteration 75 ...\nIteration 100 ...\nIteration 125 ...\nIteration 150 ...\nIteration 175 ...\nIteration 200 ...\nIteration 225 ...\nIteration 250 ...\nIteration 275 ...\nIteration 300 ...\nIteration 325 ...\nIteration 350 ...\nIteration 375 ...\nIteration 400 ...\nIteration 425 ...\nIteration 450 ...\nIteration 475 ...\nIteration 500 ...\nGibbs sampling completed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# get most representative words by topic by higher probability\ntopic_text <- lda_topics %>%\n  group_by(topic) %>%\n  top_n(15, beta) %>%\n  ungroup() \n\n# Plot in descending order\nggplot(\n  topic_text,\n  aes(x = fct_reorder(term, beta), \n      y = beta, \n      fill = as.factor(topic))\n  ) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"6 Different Industries Derived from LDA\"\n  ) +\n  theme_fivethirtyeight()+\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#dfdfeb\",colour=\"#dfdfeb\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill=\"#dfdfeb\",colour=\"#dfdfeb\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe companies can generally be classified under these 6 Industries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic.\nIndustry\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nIndustrial\nManages equipment, machinery and other industrial materials\n\n\n2\nFood\nVegetables, meat, fruits and other groceries\n\n\n3\nSeafood-processing\nPackaging, canning, manufacturing of marine or seafood products\n\n\n4\nConsumer-goods\nNon-fishing related accessories, furniture, apparel\n\n\n5\nTransport-logistics\nCompanies specialising in logistics, freight, cargo services\n\n\n6\nFishing\nCompanies directly related to fishing of salmon, tuna, etc\n\n\n\nWhile most companies fall under a single industry, there were some companies that had a high probability of being classified under more than a single industry.

Separate graphlets (clusters) within the network that are linked by entities could suggest possible joint ventures – this is most apparent in the Industrial, Fishing and Seafood-processing network, where several pairs of companies (of different industries and sub-clusters) are linked by one or more entities. These companies are:\n\nSeaSolutions Leska Kga Worldwide (Seafood-processing) & Karelians Plc Marine conservation (Industrial), linked by John Williams (Multi-role Entity)\nAqua Aura SE Marine life (Fishing-related) & Irish Mackeral S.A. de C.V. Marine Biology (Seafood-processing), linked by Dale Rhodes & Cynthia Murphy (Shareholders) and Leah Criz & Jilian White (Company contacts)\nSeashell Sanctum Co Family (Industrial) & Khundu N V and Son’s (Seafood-processing) linked by Amy Martinez (Shareholder)\nAdriatic Tuna Seabass BV Transit (Fishing-related) & Fisher Marine Conservation CJSC Transportation (Industrial), linked by Mathew Mora (Shareholder)\n\nOf particular interest is the fact that in almost all of these flagged pairs of linked companies, one of the companies have a company name that suggests involvement in the study of marine biology or conservation efforts: Karelians Plc Marine conservation, Irish Mackeral S.A. de C.V. Marine Biology, etc. This is particularly fishy, and reminiscent of the case study on Japanese Whaling industry, where Japanese whalers hunt whales under the guise of ‘scientific research’, exploiting a loophole in International Whaling Commission (IWC) rules, which allows whaling for conservation research purposes. Similarly, these fishy structures could be hiding IUU activity under the guise of reasearch or conservation efforts."

    "text": "Fishy Business\n\n Project Overview\nFishEye International, a non-profit focused on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been given access to an international finance corporation’s database on fishing related companies. In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other “fishy” business). FishEye has transformed the database into a knowledge graph. It includes information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status. FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU.\nFishEye analysts have attempted to use traditional node-link visualizations and standard graph analyses, but these were found to be ineffective because the scale and detail in the data can obscure a business’s true structure. Can you help FishEye develop a new visual analytics approach to better understand fishing business anomalies?\n\n\n Project Objectives\nThis study aims to address the following tasks in sequence:\n\n1: Identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph\n2: Develop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them, focusing on a business’s most important features and present those features clearly to the user.\n3: Measure similarity of businesses that you group in task 2, and express confidence in your groupings visually\n4: Provide evidence for or against the case that anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing, based on analysis in tasks 1-3, and suggest Which business groups FishEye should investigate further.\n\n\n\n Proposed Methodology\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Task 1:\\nIdentify\\nAnomalies} -->|patterns?|B[products or\\nservices]\n  A -->|suspicious?|C[revenue]\n  A -->|abnormal?|D[links]\n  A -.- E{Task 2:\\nGrouping} -.- I{Tasks 3&4}\n  E -->|overlaps?|F(Company Contacts)\n  E -->|overlaps?|G(Beneficial Owners)\n  E -->|similarities?|H(Country)\n  E -->|similarities?|C\n  E -->|similarities?|B\n  I --> J([Evaluative Metrics])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shiny App\nThe proposed Shiny App will be an interactive Network Graph visualising different groups of businesses. It will consist of several tabs, highlighing important information related to the tasks:\nI. Entities with Fishy Data patterns\nII. Grouping options for the Network, visualised in an interactive Network Graph (visNetwork)\nIII. Proposed Clusters based on user input on clustering criteria\nIV.
