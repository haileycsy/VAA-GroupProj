<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Project Brief</h1>
<p>FishEye International, a non-profit focused on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been given access to an international finance corporation’s database on <strong>fishing related companies.</strong> In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other <em>fishy</em> business). FishEye has transformed the database into a knowledge graph, including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status. FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate if a company is involved in IUU.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective:</strong></p>
<p>This study aims to use visual analytics to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph</strong></li>
<li><strong>develop a visual analytics process to find similar companies and group them</strong></li>
<li><strong>focus on presenting key features of the business to the user</strong></li>

<li><code>skimr</code> and <code>Hmisc</code> for generating summary statistics of dataframes and variables</li>
<li><code>DT</code>, kable<code>and</code>kableExtra` for styling tables from dataframes</li>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> and <code>ggpubr</code> for plot visualisations</li>
<li><code>scales</code> to complement <code>ggplot2</code>, specifically for specifying axes breaks</li>
<li><code>ggrain</code> for raincloud plots to visualise density distributions</li>
<li><code>patchwork</code> for multiple plot layouts</li>
<li><code>visNetwork</code>, <code>ggraph</code> and <code>igraph</code> for network graph visualisations</li>
<li><code>ggthemes</code> to standardise plot aesthetics</li>
<li><code>tidytext</code>, <code>tm</code> &amp; <code>wordcloud2</code> for text mining and visualisation</li>

<p>Summary statistics of <strong>Nodes</strong> data shows that there are 27622 rows but fewer unique ids (22929). This suggests that there are either duplicated rows in the data, or ids could have different entries with variations in data for different columns (eg company operating in different countries will have 1 row per country operating in).</p>
<p><code>product_services</code> also has 3244 unique values, with character range of 4- 1737, indicating a need to recode the descriptions of products or services into usable categories for further analysis.</p>
<p><code>revenue_omu</code> has 21515 missing values, representing companies that have unreported revenue. This may be a possible indicator of <em>fishy</em> activity. The histogram and percentile values displayed also suggests a <strong>highly right-skewed distribution of revenue</strong>.</p>

<p>Aggregation of the <strong>source</strong> variable reveals that there are companies with large numbers of links. This distribution is also highly right-skewed, indicating that most companies only recorded a single link. As more links point toward larger (and often more complex) networks, this could be an indicator of possible <em>fishy</em> activity.</p>
<p><strong>II. Cleaning up grouped data in Source column</strong></p>
<p>The aggregated dataframe also revealed that the Source column contains vector-like strings with multiple company names, eg. <em>c(“The Sea Turtle Company”, “The Sea Turtle Company”) and c(“Haryana s Catchers ОАО Enterprises”, “Drakensberg Limited Liability Company”).</em>:</p>

<li><strong>Limited Liability</strong> or <strong>LLC</strong> refers to privately owned businesses (fewer Owners). These companies are managed by the owners or “members” that could be individuals or other business entities</li>
<li><strong>Publicly Listed Companies</strong> or <strong>PLC</strong> refers to companies owned by shareholders (larger number of owners), and are managed by a single director or board of directors<br>

<p><strong>ZH has highest number of companies but lower average revenue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The treemap of revenue by country reveals that <strong>Alverovia has only a single listed company but highest average recorded revenue: OceanFront Foods SRL Line</strong></li>
<li>There are also several other Countries with fewer listed companies such as <strong>Rosvandor, Azurionix and Osterivaria</strong> that recorded higher average revenue than the country with most listed companies, ZH.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, companies from these countries with higher average revenue but fewer companies listed mostly offer <strong>products and services unrelated to fishing</strong>. This suggests that <strong>both fishing-related and non-fishing related companies need to be examined further</strong> – and that there may be <em>fishy</em> connections between companies from different industries that may cover up IUU activities.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the section above, analysis showed that <strong>higher average revenue has a strong relation to non-fishing related companies.</strong> Summary statistics also revealed that the <strong>product_services</strong> variable has a large range of characters, that makes it difficult to classify the companies into industries for comparison. Text mining in the form of Tokenisation, as well as Topic Modeling (an unsupervised learning method) were used to deconstruct the text present in <strong>product_services</strong> to form more meaningful categories.</p>

<p>The wordcloud reveals that <strong>fishing-related products</strong> seem to appear the most frequently. However, there are several words that appear frequently enough to take note of:</p>
<ul>
<li>equipment</li>
<li>industrial</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>freelance</li>
<li>researcher</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>freelance researcher</strong> was found to be listed as the source of information for products and services. This was thus not an accurate representation of industry category. As the use of just singular words may be taken out of context, especially from phrases used in longer descriptions, further analysis was conducted for <strong>pairs of words (bigrams)</strong></p>

<p>Topic Modeling is an unsupervised machine learning method suitable for data exploration. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is useful for ‘clustering’ text into groups of similar meanings. Similar to k-means Clustering algorithms, the number of topics (or ‘clusters’) <code>k</code> is the most important parameter to define. In the event that <code>k</code> is too small, the topics may be over-generalised; if <code>k</code> is too large, however, topics may be overlapping or not useful for interpretation. To determine the optimal number of topics <code>k</code>, the <code>FindTopicsNumber</code> plot is used to compare models for different values of <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>In a report published by Trygg Mat Tracking (TMT), an international not-for-profit organisation that investigates illegal fishing operations and associated crimes, many <em>fishy</em> operators use <strong>Shell Companies, Front companies and joint ventures to cover up illegal operations with complex company structures so as to conceal the Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO).</strong> (2020)</p>
<p>Revealing the company ownership and company contact structure through network graph visualisations of different groups could help uncover hidden patterns and owners in the network. This will give a better sense of how the individual records listed in the <strong>links</strong> data are related, as well as sieve out possible <em>fishy</em> patterns.</p>
<div class="fishbox fish">
<p><strong>The following filters are used to investigate possible ‘groups’ and anomalies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High Revenue &amp; Companies with Higher numbers of Beneficial Owners</li>
<li>Beneficial Owners of higher number of Companies</li>
<li>Company Contacts of higher number of Companies</li>
<li>Companies with Transboundary Operations</li>

<p>Exploratory analysis thus far has revealed some underlying structures of various groups within the network. The most anomalous (and interlinked) sub-networks, High Revenue and High Link Count and Beneficial Owners with Multiple Companies, are concatenated to further investigate if these fishy structures are interlinked, as well as grouping companies and entities by categories.</p>
<p>The “group” that the entity is assigned is based on the following roles:</p>
<table class="table">

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Ultimate Beneficial Owner</strong></td>
<td>Beneficial Owner of &gt; 3 Companies, a key player in the network</td>
