<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Project Brief</h1>
<p>FishEye International, a non-profit focused on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been given access to an international finance corporation’s database on <strong>fishing related companies.</strong> In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other <em>fishy</em> business). FishEye has transformed the database into a knowledge graph, including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status. FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate if a company is involved in IUU.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective:</strong></p>
<p>This study aims to use visual analytics to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>measure similarity of business groups</strong></li>
<li><strong>provide evidence for and against the case that anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be investigated through both <strong>visual</strong> and <strong>quantitative</strong> means: visualising the networks from various industries present in the network graph could help identify if <em>anomalous</em> network structures uncovered in <em>Fishy Business</em> are more prominent or present in certain industries. Network Similarity measures will also be used to quantify these similarities from the graph objects.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jaccard-similarity-index"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Jaccard Similarity Index</h2>
<p>The <strong>Jaccard similarity index</strong> compares the presence or absence of edges (links) between pairs of nodes in the networks, calculating the ratio of the number of common edges to the total number of edges in both networks. A higher Jaccard Similarity score thus suggests a greater overlap in edge connections, which makes the networks relatively more similar in terms of overall <em>connectivity</em>.</p>
<p>The measure is calculated for each pair of Industry-classified networks, with the data stored as a matrix. This is then visualised through a heatmap:</p>

<p>This measure provides a way to compare the local structural patterns between networks, focusing on the distribution of orbit types. It captures the similarity or dissimilarity in the occurrence of specific subgraph patterns within the network, which can provide insights into their functional properties, evolution, or dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Similarities in Network Structures Across Industries:</strong></p>
<p>Similarities in Network structure can be derived from both Jaccard Similarity (JS) and Orbit Distribution Agreement (ODA) scores presented in the heatmap. The lighter the tile, the less similar these ‘groups’ are.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highly similar industries:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fishing &amp; Seafood-processing Industries</strong> have the very high JS and ODA index of nearly 1.0, suggestive of almost identical network structures.</li>
<li><strong>Seafood &amp; Industrial</strong> and <strong>Fishing &amp; Industrial</strong> structures also scored nearly 1.0 for both similarity measures. This suggests that these industries may be overlapping, highly related or interconnected with each other.</li>
</ul></li>

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> A <em>Fishy</em> Network?</h1>
<p>Many of the ‘groups’ of companies by industry had high jaccard similarity and Orbit Distribution scores, which suggests that there is a significant overlap in the connections and relationships between companies, owners, and contacts involved in the overall network between industries. These network diagrams are visualised to compare the graphlet structures within the expanded networks, to determine if there are <em>fishy</em> ties between entities across industries.</p>
<p>In particular, networks with <strong>high Jaccard similarity</strong> could indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration and Cooperation between industries</li>
<li>Cross-Industry Syndicates that span across multiple industries, coordinating illegal fishing activities and exploiting resources collectively.</li>
<li>Common entities who benefit from illegal fishing practices</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>high Orbit Distribution Agreement</strong> could also suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Network Dynamics or organizational structures. This could involve shared roles, relationships, or coordination mechanisms among key actors involved in illegal fishing.</li>
<li>Coordinated Activities between industries</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the following subgroups of networks are visualised for further comparison:</p>

<p>From the analysis thus far, we can surmise that <strong>anomalous company structures</strong> may be derived from inter-industry networks, understanding any underlying links between companies as well as looking for overlapping ownership structures. Separate graphlets (clusters) within the network that are linked by entities could suggest possible <strong>joint ventures</strong> – this is most apparent in the Industrial, Fishing and Seafood-processing network, where several pairs of companies (of different industries and sub-clusters) are linked by one or more entities. These companies are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SeaSolutions Leska Kga Worldwide (Seafood-processing) &amp; Karelians Plc Marine conservation (Industrial), linked by John Williams (Multi-role Entity)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aqua Aura SE Marine life (Fishing-related) &amp; Irish Mackeral S.A. de C.V. Marine Biology (Seafood-processing), linked by Dale Rhodes &amp; Cynthia Murphy (Shareholders) and Leah Criz &amp; Jilian White (Company contacts)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seashell Sanctum Co Family (Industrial) &amp; Khundu N V and Son’s (Seafood-processing) linked by Amy Martinez (Shareholder)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adriatic Tuna Seabass BV Transit (Fishing-related) &amp; Fisher Marine Conservation CJSC Transportation (Industrial), linked by Mathew Mora (Shareholder)</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest is the fact that in almost all of these flagged pairs of linked companies, one of the companies have a company name that suggests involvement in the study of marine biology or conservation efforts: Karelians Plc Marine conservation, Irish Mackeral S.A. de C.V. Marine Biology, etc. This is particularly <em>fishy</em>, and reminiscent of the case study on Japanese Whaling industry, where Japanese whalers hunt whales under the guise of ‘scientific research’, <a href="https://uk.whales.org/our-4-goals/stop-whaling/whaling-in-japan/">exploiting a loophole in International Whaling Commission (IWC) rules</a>, which allows whaling for conservation research purposes. Similarly, these <em>fishy</em> structures could be hiding IUU activity under the guise of reasearch or conservation efforts.</p>
